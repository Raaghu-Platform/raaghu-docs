Customizing the Modules
-----------------------

ABP Commercial [modules](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/7.2/modules/index) are designed to be extensible and customizable. They fully implement the extensibility system that is defined by the ABP Framework. See the [Customizing the Application Modules](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Customizing-Application-Modules-Guide) guide to learn different ways of extending/customizing a module.
